<h1> Here are some details about Allan Alvarez</h1>
<p> Hello there, my name is Allan Alvarez. I love spending my free time playing video games like Monster Hunter 
 or Pokemon and I am a fan of anime as well with one of my favorites being Danganronpa.
 I got into Computer Science because of my love for video games so I want to create video games myself. It has been a rocky
 road these past 3 years since I feel like I haven't learnt much but this senior year of my college I am finally using
 all of the knowledge I never thought I would need. I get to show off my skills and become more confident 
 in my ability to learn as someone who enjoys a challenge. Coding is intimidating for me but I always manage to pull through
 and come out on top learning that I am smarter than I think I am. I want to be a successful video game programmer and to do that
 I will have to keep pushing myself despite my slight fear of coding new things. I enjoy the "eureka" moment I get when
 something I have been working on for so long finally looks and works the way I want it to. I even take pride in making this HTML code by
 myself since I have to look up all the different commands for HTML and I can honestly say it is pretty fun to see something work so fast. </p>
